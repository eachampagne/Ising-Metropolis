# Ising-Metropolis
Class Project for University of Arizona PHYS 426

Summary:
<TODO>

TODO:
-Write summary of project above
-Go to office hours for questions
-Figure out random number generation
-Change current Ensemble class to a parent class with 1d and 2d children
-Rest of the project

Running list of questions for this project:
-<Generally make certain I know what I'm doing>
-Can we/Should we give the link to the GitHub repository?
-Do we turn in code or just results? Makefiles? Does that mean energy, or the actual sequence of states?
-Do we have to have charts or our lattices? It would be nice but might be hard to accomplish...
-A way to save data would be nice, but would definitely affect effiency
-Any preferences on coding style? Is using classes okay? Inheritence? Does code optimization count for anything?
-Is there a definite size for lattice? Apparently 32; 32x32
-Any advice for randomly assigning the initial state?
-We have to do both 1D and 2D? (I think so)
-I assume there's a paper to answer questions, discuss results. Any particular formatting? Should we explicitly number the questions we are given?
-If you flip multiple spins at a time, do you either accept/reject all of them or accept/reject individually? What if some of the selected spins are neighbors?
-What is J? How does J depend on T?
-There's a Cv equation from the 10/14 lecture that's probably useful
-Can I post the instructions pdf to GitHub since this is resume material?
